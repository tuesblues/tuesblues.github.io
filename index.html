	<section>   <p> Hello, and welcome to <strong>Tuesday's Library!</strong> Here you will find poetry and think-pieces by yours truly. I have been a fan of poetry since my early teen years, but I only started <em>writing</em> it in my final year of high school when I was encouraged by a really great English teacher who told me that I am <em>"gifted,"</em> which is compliment that I will always remember. </p>
	
	<p> My biggest inspirations are <strong>Emily Dickinson, Ocean Vuong,</strong> and <strong>Wendy Cope;</strong> To those familiar with their work, I think this is somewhat apparent in my poems. </p>
